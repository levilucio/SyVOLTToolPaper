The Idea here is to indroduce the features that had to be implemented for the
approach to work/scale for each one of the cases studies, from the simplest to
the most complex.\cgg{I would move this part to the discussion section. Because it is a consequence of the case study and not part of the case study itself.}

\item insights into applying model driven techniques
\item applicability
